# Smart-home
Mobile-Controlled Home is a Bluetooth-based home automation project that allows users to control basic household devices using a mobile phone. The system is designed to manage access for up to 10 users through a simple login interface that requires a username and password. Once authenticated, users can remotely control a light (LED) and operate a door, all via Bluetooth communication.
